---- UI ----

* When switching tabs from bottom navbar, the TopNavBar and BottomNavBar show way earlier than the
  actual page, it's very clunky.

* -- Bottom Nav Bar --
* Make navigation appear to slide left and right instead of fade in and out.

* -- Side Navigation Bar --

* -- MovesList --

  -- EditMove --

* -- Combo Generator --
* Save Combo should be a heart icon instead of floppy disk

  -- Saved Combos --

  -- Edit Saved Combo --

  -- Goals Screen --

-- Edit Goal --

* When adding a goal
    * title should be Add Goal instead of Edit Goal
    * Should not see archive or delete button since goal was not created yet.
* Progress bar should not appear when there are no goal stages
* A progress bar at zero has this weird dot on the right end for some reason
* When a goal stage is added, the goal itself should be saved. Otherwise a user can exit early and
  there will be a goalstage pointing to a goal that was never saved.
* So Apparently a goal with the same goal tag DOES exist, but unnamed. I think that before adding a
  goal stage, Goal Name should be required. How should we fix this?
* Have three dot menu or edit button on the goals in the list.

* -- Timer Screen --
* Have it display milliseconds too
* I like the idea of scrolling through numbers similar to android clock stopwatch. This is better UX
  than having to type in a number.
* I also want a circle around the time that will fill up to indicate the time left.

* -- Battle Combo Page --

* -- Edit Battle Combo --

* -- Archived Goals --
* Top nav bar with back button should be there like in manage tags
* Implement Last
